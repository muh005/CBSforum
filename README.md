# CBSforum

## Introduction
Chinese Business Society is a business society which is dedicated in providing UCSD students, who are interested in 
the growing business fields, especially in Finance, Consulting, Investment Banking and Accounting Careers, with broad 
socializing opportunities to get more information about what their actual dream jobs are. We welcome students with 
different cultural backgrounds but we mainly focus on International students, especially Native Chinese students who 
are willing acquire hands on experience and professional networking within the U.S. The club member's desired majors 
are Management Science, Economics, Math Joint Economics, Accounting Minor, Business Minor and Information Technology.

## Idea
With the growing demand for internship resource, we find out that traditional social media might not be powerful enough.
Society media, such as wechat and facebook, cannot hold resource permanently. In order to hold information, as well as,
to enhance social networking, we invent this CBSforum. We hope people who come here will have better job opportunity and 
they can bring more job resource back later.
